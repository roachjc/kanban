# Kanban

## Getting Started

1. `npm i` - Install dependencies. This might take a while.
2. `npm start` - Run development build. 

## Also

Beyond development, the boilerplate supports other tasks listed below:

* `npm run build` - Generates a production build below `build/`.
* `npm run deploy` - Deploys the contents of the `build/` directory below the **gh-pages** branch.
* `npm run test` - Runs `tests/` through Karma/Phantom/Mocha once.
* `npm run test:tdd` - Runs `tests/` in a TDD mode (watches for changes and rebuilds).
* `npm run test:lint` - Runs code through ESLint to spot code quality issues.
